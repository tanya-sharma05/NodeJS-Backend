1. Node JS is a runtime environment to run JavaScript outside our browser.
2. It uses V8 engine and C++ APIs (libuv (C++ library))
3. FRONTEND -> React JS (library)
4. BACKEND -> Express JS (framework) 
5. Node JS is single-threaded -> only 1 line can execute at a time.
6. Synchronous (Blocking) -> Each task waits for the previous task to finish.
7. Asynchronous (Non-blocking) -> Does not waits (Node's Event Loop + Callback Queue handles async operations)
    (V8 executes JS code and libuv handles async tasks)
    Node.js has 4 threads in the thread pool (a group of worker threads available to perform tasks)
